# What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stand for continous intregration and continous delivery/continous deployment.
In very simple terms, CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably. Automated build-and-test steps triggered by CI ensure that code changes being merged into the repository are reliable.
| Why is CI/CD important  | What is the difference between CD and CD  |
|---|---|
| CI/CD allows organizations to ship software quickly and efficiently. CI/CD facilitates an effective process for getting products to market faster than ever before, continuously delivering code into production, and ensuring an ongoing flow of new features and bug fixes via the most efficient delivery method.   |   Continuous delivery (CD) is the automated delivery of completed code to environments like testing and development. CD provides an automated and consistent way for code to be delivered to these environments. Continuous deployment is the next step of continuous delivery. Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically placed in production, resulting in many production deployments.|

In short, CI is a set of practices performed *as developers are writing* code, and CD is a set of practices performed *after* the code is **completed**.

## What are the benefits of CI/CD?

- Automated testing enables continuous delivery, which ensures software quality and security and increases the profitability of code in production
- CI/CD pipelines enable a much shorter time to market for new product features, creating happier customers and lowering strain on development
- The great increase in overall speed of delivery enabled by CI/CD pipelines improves an organizationâ€™s competitive edge
- Automation frees team members to focus on what they do best, yielding the best end products
- Organizations with a successful CI/CD pipeline can attract great talent - by moving away from traditional waterfall methods, engineers and developers are no longer bogged down with repetitive activities that are often highly dependent on the completion of other tasks
