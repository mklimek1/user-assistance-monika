# I Want It That Way
>You are
>My fire
The one
>Desire
Believe
>When I say
*I want it that way*
`But we are two worlds`
`apart`
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
- [x] I want in that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

### Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
### Tell me why 
Ain't nothing but a mistake
## Tell me why
**I never wanna hear you say**
- [x] I want in that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

Am I
~Your fire~
Your one
~Desire~
==Yes I know==
~It's too late~
- [x] I want in that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

### Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
### Tell me why 
Ain't nothing but a mistake
## Tell me why
**I never wanna hear you say**
- [x] I want in that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

*Now I can see that we've fallen apart*
**From the way that it used to be** 
No matter the distance I want you to know 
That deep down inside of me

You are
~My fire~
The one
~Desire~
# You are
## You are 
### You are
Don't wanna hear you say
: Ain't nothing but a heartache
: Ain't nothing but a mistake
: I never wanna hear you say
**I want it that way**
