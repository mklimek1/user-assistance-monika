# I Want It That Way
You are	<br>
My fire <br>
The one <br>
Desire <br>
Believe <br>
When I say <br>

*I want it that way*

But we are two worlds <br>
`apart`<br>
Can't reach to your heart <br>
When you say <br>
- [x] I want in that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

### Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
### Tell me why 
Ain't nothing but a mistake
## Tell me why
**I never wanna hear you say**
- [x] I want in that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

Am I
### ~~Your fire~~
Your one

~Desire~

Yes I know
### ~~It's too late~~
- [x] I want it that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

### Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
### Tell me why 
Ain't nothing but a mistake
## Tell me why
**I never wanna hear you say**
- [x] I want in that way
- [ ] I want it the other way

*Now I can see that we've fallen apart*  

**From the way that it used to be**  

No matter the distance I want you to know  

That deep down inside of me <br>

You are <br>
~~My fire~~ <br>
The one <br>
~Desire~ <br>
### You are
## You are 
# You are
Don't wanna hear you say <br>
Ain't nothing but a heartache <br>
Ain't nothing but a mistake <br>
I never wanna hear you say <br>
**I want it that way**
